# opencv-python-traffic-lights
OpenCV Python program that identifies traffic lights and their state (red, green, yellow) from dash cam photos

* I have included the python and jupyter notebook files (**opencv_python_traffic_lights_main**). I have included a static html printout of the jupyter notebook with outputs. 

* I have included the dash camera images and the backprojection training images (both under **images**) and the ground truth locations of the traffic lights (as a csv and xlsx).

* Please see the wiki for a detailed write up on what the program is doing. The images in the wiki are located in **imagesforwiki**
