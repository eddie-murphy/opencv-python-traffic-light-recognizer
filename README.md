# opencv-python-traffic-lights
OpenCV Python program that identifies traffic lights and their state (red, green, yellow) from dash cam photos

I have included the python and jupyter notebook files. I have included a static html printout of hte jupyter notebook with outputs. 

I have included the dash camera images (under images) and the ground truth locations of the traffic lights.
